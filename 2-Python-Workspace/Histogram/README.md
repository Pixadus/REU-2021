# Histogram

This section is used to compare OCCULT-2 automatic tracings to manual tracings found through the Curve-Tracing folder. 

## TODO

- [x] Visual histogram comparisons
- [ ] Make this fully automatic. Once it's properly intepreting titles, should automatically provide best result. 
- * To accomplish this, compare the differences between average curve lengths and total number of detected fibrils. Provide a list. 
- [ ] Make a 'Use' section here.
